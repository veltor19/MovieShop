3 big cloud providers
1. AWS
2. Azure Microsoft

3. GCP Google

MovieShop App => local machine

1. Domain Name => movieshop.com => GoDaddy, Google Domains
2. Deploy your Application Code => MVC to a server => 
	1. Windows Server 2019 => IIS
	2. Linux Server => Ngix
3. Build your own server
	Windows Server => Intel Xenon 24 core processor, 128Gb Ram, 4TB of Hard Disk => Dell
	Install the OS => Windows Server 2019 (buy software from microsoft)
	IIS will be inside the server


1. 
Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
Option 1. Go to a Cloud Provider
Buy Virtual Machines with either windows or linux
IIS or Ngix i can use to deploy the app
Install Sql Server

Option 2. Platform as a Service(PaaS)
Azure App Service => Deploy your MVC applications
Azure SQL => Sql Datbase in Cloud
Azure DevOps => 

Azure Functions => Serverless Functions => running a piece of code in the server without managing any server infrastructure
Azure Blob Storage => storing files, images, videos, etc
Azure Conginitive Services => text analysis, speech, image recognition, sentiment

Software as a Service(SaaS)
Office 365
Google Docs
Microsoft teams
Slack

DevOps
Development + Operations
People from dev teams and people from operations team combine to make sure your code is running properly

Development Team =>
DevOps Team => 

Continuus Integration(CI) => The practice used by development teams of automating merging and testing code.
Implementing CI helps to catch bugs early in the development cycle, which makes them less expensive to fix.
Automated tests execute as part of the CI process to ensure quality.
Artifacts are produced from CI systems and fed to release processes to drive frequent deployments
The Build service in azure DevOps Server helps you set up and manage CI for you applications

Continuous Delivery(CD) => Is a process by which code is built, tested, and deployed to one or more test and production environments.
Deploying and testing in multiple environments increases quality.
CI systems produce deployable artifacts, including infrastructure and apps.
Automated release process consume these artifacts to release new versions and fixes to existing system
Monitoring and altering systems run continually to drive visibility into the entire CD process

QA team => will test appplication functionality end to end

Feature Branches => will get code from master/main branch
Developers will add new Code in this feature branch

Feature Branch 2

Different branches (master/main branch)

Check in the code into GitHub

Azure DevOps Pipeline => DevOps Team + you will work closely with them
CI comes in to picture, it takes the code from GitHub => build the code, run the unit tests, then generate a artifact
CD => will take the artifacts and publishes/deploys the code to anywhere (IIS in Windows VM, Ngix in Linx VM, Azure App Service)
